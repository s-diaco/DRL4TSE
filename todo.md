# - automatic optimization of hyperparameters
# - implement handling of variable episode lenghs
# - use other agents
# - implement single-day predict function
# - why is average episode lenght not constant?
# - CSVData class should havea simpler constructor
# - remove train log dirs when needed
# - automatic hyperparameter tuning
# - is data normaization needed for other models?
# - add tic to data columns needs some work
